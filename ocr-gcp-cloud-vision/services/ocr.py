About the Module:
Module for implementing simple Nitric-based APIs for
a mock OCR use-case which uses the Google Cloud Vision API.

About OCR:
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) enables a user
to detect and extract text from images and documents.

User Journeys (exposed API operations):
1. A user should be able to create their user profile.
2. A user should be able to retrieve details of their user profile.
No security patterns like Authorization, Authentication, Identification, etc.
have been enforced as the shown APIs are for demonstration purposes only.
A sample (written in JavaScript) for security could be found at:
https://nitric.io/docs/guides/getting-started/nodejs/secure-api-auth0
3. A user should be able to upload an image (single, for demo purposes).
The image upload API should only work for users who have their
user profiles created.
Note: No Authorization, Authentication, Identification, etc. patterns
have been applied and the request is validated just based on the correct
UUID (for user profile).
4. A user should be able to retrieve the text corresponding to the
uploaded image; OCR is applied on the image to retrieve text from the image.
The detected text is uploaded to the user's profile metadata and the same
should be retrievable from the API that returns a user's profile information
based on the UUID supplied.

Where to Run:
This Nitric-powered Python application can be run on any supported
provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.). However, since the application makes
use of the Google Cloud Vision API, having access to the same is necessary.
If extending from this codebase, the Google Cloud Vision API could be replaced
by the OCR API of choice.

Disclaimer:
This codebase is not production-ready and is meant
for demonstration purposes only. The codebase doesn't necessarily
cover API design and security best practices.
